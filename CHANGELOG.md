## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added
- üåç **Complete Internationalization (i18n) Support**: Multi-language support for CLI output and reports
  - English (en) - Default language
  - Chinese Simplified (zh) - ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá

  - French (fr) - Fran√ßais
  - German (de) - Deutsch
  - Spanish (es) - Espa√±ol
- üîß **Language Selection**: New `--lang` CLI parameter for manual language selection
- ü§ñ **Auto-detection**: Automatic language detection from environment variables (`FLOWSPEC_LANG`, `LANG`)
- üìã **Localized Reports**: All report outputs now support multiple languages
- üí¨ **Localized CLI Messages**: All CLI messages and logs now support internationalization
- üß™ **Comprehensive i18n Testing**: Full test coverage for internationalization features

### Changed
- üìä **Report Rendering**: Enhanced report renderer with internationalization system
- üñ•Ô∏è **CLI Interface**: Enhanced CLI with language selection capabilities
- üåê **Default Behavior**: Reports now default to English unless otherwise specified or auto-detected
- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**: Added dedicated `internal/i18n` package for internationalization

### Fixed
- üîß **JSONLogic Type Conversion**: Fixed critical JSONLogic evaluation errors with interface type conversions
- üîç **Variable Path Resolution**: Improved variable path handling in assertion evaluation
- üìä **Test Data Consistency**: Fixed test data mismatches between ServiceSpec assertions and trace data
- üìù **YAML Parsing**: Resolved duplicate key issues in ServiceSpec YAML parsing

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Improved test coverage for internationalization features
- Better separation of concerns with dedicated i18n package
- More robust CLI parameter validation
- Performance optimized translation system (< 1¬µs per translation)
- Thread-safe concurrent language switching

### Performance
- **Translation Performance**: < 1¬µs per translation operation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Zero runtime allocation for translations
- **Concurrent Safety**: Full thread-safe support for language switching
- **Startup Time**: No impact on CLI startup performance

- üìã Human and JSON format report renderer.
- üîß Complete command-line interface.
- üß™ Comprehensive test suite (unit tests + integration tests).
- üìñ Complete project documentation.

### Features
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports parsing of Java, TypeScript, and Go source code.

- Memory usage: 100MB trace file, peak memory < 500MB.
- Test coverage: Core modules > 80%.

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.21+
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra
- **Assertion Engine**: JSONLogic
- **Logging System**: Logrus
- **Testing Framework**: Go testing + Testify
